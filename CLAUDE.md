The role of this file is to describe common mistakes and confusion points that agents might encounter as they work in this project.

## Purpose

This project is a deck optimizer for "Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories" game, "Remastered Perfected" mod. Given a player's card collection, it generates an optimal 40-card monster deck that maximizes the **expected value of the highest attack** achievable from a random 5-card opening hand, considering both direct card plays and fusion chains.
